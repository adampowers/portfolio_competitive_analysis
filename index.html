    </td>
    <td>Interactive storybook. Entices you to explore and click.</td>
    <td>Everything you need is above the fold, though it's not apparent at first.</td>
    <td>This site is meant to be explored, like a children's book laid end-to-end. Perspective shifting happens when you move the mouse. You can click on the character's nose to start music playing.</td>
    <td>The nav is simple; at first, you explore beneath the fold to see what other content there is, but the nav elements simply repeat between scenes.</td>

    <td>Bright; colorful.</td>
    <td>Most of the page is image. Little can be clicked on.</td>
    <td>Color highlights on mouseover.</td>
    <td>The nav bar up top is handy, but there's too much scrolling required to get to everything else.</td>

    </td>
    <td>Bright; professional; fun.</td>
    <td>Very functional and informative. The entire site changes on "next".</td>
    <td>Nice image popups on click. Good highlighting when mousing over images.</td>
    <td>The nav for each subsite is great, but moving between subsites is unintuitive (e.g. you don't know it's a design house, you think its sole purpose is to produce the book seen on the first page).</td>

    </td>
    <td>Fun; silly; edgy? The mascot is a strange selling point.</td>
    <td>The site has nearly everything you'd want to know readily accessible.</td>
    <td>Fantastic animations on portfolio clicks. Good mouseover transitions.</td>
    <td>The site is very well laid-out, with nav and portfolio examples all above the fold. Great "return" button on portfolio views where the close button would be on native windows.</td>

    <td>Professional; bright.</td>
      <td>Good layout obviates the need for multiple sub-pages. Site works well.</td>
      <td>Nice toaster pop animation when portfolio items are selected on the main page.</td>

    </td>
    <td>Elegant; illustrated.</td>
    <td>Functional, but surprisingly cluttered beneath the fold.</td>
    <td>Interesting (but not compelling) animations on menu mouseover. Good smooth scrolling animation on anchors.</td>
    <td>This site would work a lot better with multiple subpages. Having repeating nav bars is always annoying.</td>

    </td>
    <td>Bright; whimsically elegant. Follows the "twitter" school of design.</td>
    <td>I really enjoyed the pop-up ribbon with a legend for which type of design it is, though you could easily argue that with better design it wouldn't be necessary. Also enjoyed the "return to top" button that follows you around.</td>
    <td>Fade-ins on the ribbon, decent transitions.</td>
    <td>Not much to do other than scroll 'n click.</td>

    </td>
    <td>Illustrated; whimsical.</td>
    <td>Most of the relevant information is above the fold, and there's not much reason to go elsewhere. That being said, did the main graphic need to be so big? It pushes nav down and you lose a column in the gallery.</td>
    <td>Lightbox on portfolio item click; no highlighting on mouseover. Could be better.</td>
    <td>Would be nice if more of the contact items were above the fold. At least the gallery is front and center.</td>

    </td>
    <td>Dark; edgy.</td>
    <td>I don't feel there needed to be as many subpages as there were. When some subsections have a majority of the gallery slots crossed out because there's nothing to put there, something's wrong.</td>
    <td>Not much other than mouseover highlights and clicking on the lightbox.</td>
    <td>Nav is fine; nothing special. Gallery is nice and prominent.</td>

    <td>Professional; bright.</td>
    <td>Does what is needed, no more or less.</td>
    <td>You get to decide what part of the site you're viewing, with nice animations. Not much else.</td>
    <td>Nav is simple, but elegant. The top two "about" and "contact" links could be relocated to be less out-of-the-way.</td>

  <span>I'm very much embarrassed to show this; there's a reason I don't design things in pencil.<br/>
In general, though, I'll be looking to develop a conceptual logo - having the last name Powers opens a lot of doors - and come up with a great tagline that's nothing at all like the "I like making websites" that you see on every portfolio. There will hopefully be a good deal of tasteful interactivity.</span>
